# Midi_Music_From_Protein
Have you ever wondered what your favorite protein sequence would sound like as music?
This program will convert a protein fasta file from a given url and convert it into a musical midi file.
Any website link for a fasta file should work, as long as it ends with the fasta file (https://.../protein.fasta) since the
program is currently only equipped to decipher those file types.  I found uniprot.org to be a good source.
