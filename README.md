# Midi_Music_From_Protein
Have you ever wondered what your favorite protein sequence would sound like as music?
This python script will convert a protein fasta file from a given url and convert it into a musical midi file.
Any website link for a fasta file should work, as long as it ends with the fasta file (https://.../protein.fasta) since the
script is currently only equipped to decipher those file types.  I found uniprot.org to be a good source.

NOTE: this python script utilizes the pyknon library by Pedro Kroger.  It must be downloaded to run this script
I've included the library on this github page, but more information can be found at these links:
